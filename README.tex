Three R files, Study1, Study2a and Study2b, correspond to Study 1 (Simulation 3.1), Study 2a (Simulation 3.2) and Study 2b (Simulation 3.2) in the paper. 

For single-stage decision settings, in Study 1, which is illustrated as Simulation 3.1 in the paper, we consider four different scenarios to verify the double robustness property of our method.

For multi-stage decision settings, we examine two different data-generating processes that can be employed in different real situations. Study 2a is analogous to [Wallace and Moodie, 2015]’s two-stage setting, and Study 2b, which follows [Moodie et al., 2012]’s setting, distinguishes between the components that are tailoring variables and those that are predictive variables, including potential confounders.

Moreover, the Treatment-freePlot.R will output Figure 1 to show the nonlinear treatment-free function and its linear approximation. dWGLMfct.R contains the dWGLM function for the multi-stage decision settings.
